# Signature Work Portfolio - Anna Curtler

1. Microbialite Database Web Application  
   https://github.com/acurtler/MicrobialitesDBApp  

   This project involved migrating a geology professor's geologic database from Microsoft Access to PostgreSQL. I created a web application for exploring the database and learning more about the classifications of microbialites.
   
2. Crime Map  
  https://github.com/acurtler/CrimeMap

   This project was completed as part of a Web Development course at UST. The web application can be used to filter and explore St. Paul crime data. The Leaflet API was used to map the data.

3. Personal Website  
   https://github.com/acurtler/PersonalWebpage

   This project was completed as part of a Web Development course at UST. The web page displays information about me and my resume. 

4. Chloride Concentration Data Analysis  
    https://github.com/acurtler/ChlorideAnalysis

   This project was completed as part of my senior Environmental Science capstone course at UST. A partner and I performed research on chloride concentrations in Twin Cities Metro Area lakes using data from the MSP Long-Term Ecological Research Project (LTER). Chloride is an important contaminant in Minnesota because of its use in deicers during winters and snowfall events. This contaminant is transported into water bodies through water runoff. Chloride can have harmful effects on lake ecosystems because it changes the density of the water and impacts water mixing patterns, impacting where nutrients and oxygen are available in the water column. High chloride concentrations can be toxic to organisms and lead to harmful algal blooms. This research involved testing for patterns of increasing chloride concentrations in the TCMA lakes over time and for spatial patterns within the watershed. The MPCA states that watersheds with road densities of 18% or greater are at increased risk for chloride contamination, so we were interested to see how road density of a watershed related to the chloride concentration of its lakes.
